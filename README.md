# UFOs
JavaScript, HTML, & Bootstrap

## Challenge
### *(under JS folder as challenge_ap.py)*
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Summary
- Javascript and HTML code were used to create a webpage that summarizes data on UFO sightings and displays it into an organized table, along with a title and summary of the project's background. The table allows users to filter the data through several attributes related to sightings: date, city, state, country and shape. Bootstrap and CSS was utilized to style the webpage.

## Webpage

## Recommendations
- The search bars filter rigidly and that could be an issue for users. An option to make the search more flexible; allowing lowercase, uppercase, or spaces could be more user-friendly. The webpage could also use more formatting, that way it can allow for more content. Adding a map that can reference where each location is when someone sorts the data or images of UFO shapes could be of good reference as well.
